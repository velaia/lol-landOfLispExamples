Coding examples from the wonderful Land of Lisp book by Conrad Barski

To clarify my own understanding and improve readability I adjusted the code in some places. "car" and "cdr" have been replaced with "first" and "rest", "caddr" and similar constructs have also been replaced by several invocations of "first" and "rest" for clarity reasons.
